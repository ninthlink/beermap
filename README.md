# beermap
### meteor material demo
its a map(s), of beer(s), still, but built in Meteor rather than starting from a more mean idea

starting from mashup of https://github.com/meteor-useraccounts/boilerplates/tree/master/materialize-iron-router and https://github.com/dburles/geolocation-example though I think I commented out the sign in page for fun

## installation 

1. install meteor
2. download this
3. cd to the wherever you put it
4. `meteor`
5. http://localhost:3000
